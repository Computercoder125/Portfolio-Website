        <p> I have always been driven by understanding how things work underneath the hood.
            Ever since I was a little kid, I was fascinated about how a phone could perform various complex
            tasks with one touch of a finger, or how a keyboard on a computer worked to display a key on
            an internet screen. I would always look up how to utilize different functions of devices that others may have
        overlooked. This lead me to enroll in coding camps, where I strengthened my logical and programming skills
    in object-oriented programming languages like Python, C++ and C#, web based languages like
   HTML and CSS, and GUI (guided user interfaces) like Scenebuilder in Java. In fact, this website was designed through Node.js, html and css! I am looking forward to any opportunities provided
 to me in the fields of software and cybersecurity development, especially in the rapidly advancing field of AI. </p>
 <br>
 <p2>At Saint Joseph's, I am a co-president of the Computer Science Club, a community where programmers of all experiences can fiddle with different frameworks / programming
  languages, and work together to create mind-blowing yet fun projects. I also am currently a peer tutor and teaching assistant for lower level computer science classes,
  helping other students master the material and become better programmers. Additionally, I receive piano lessons and am on the jazz band where I play challenging yet enjoyable
  classical and jazz pieces.
 </p2>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p3> While not in classes or coding, I enjoy working out, playing classical and jazz songs on the piano, and hanging out with friends
  and family. I believe self-care is just as important as a strong work ethic. 
 </p3>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p4> Feel free to reach out to me with any questions/concerns, and I look forward to connecting with you.</p4>
